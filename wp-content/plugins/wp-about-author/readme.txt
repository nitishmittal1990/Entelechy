== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the background color of the box? =

Of course your can. It's one of the options available to you in the settings panel.

= Can I change the layout of the content in the box? =

As of version 1.3 you can. All you have to do is create your own HTML using the following templates tags and use a filter.

Templates tags are: %%bordertype%%, %%borderbg%%, %%authorpic%% and %%content%%

Example:
Add the following to a functionality plugin or your functions.php file
`<?php
function my_wp_about_author_template(){
    return '<div class="wp-about-author-containter-%%bordertype%%" style="background-color:%%borderbg%%;"><div class="wp-about-author-pic">%%authorpic%%</div><div class="wp-about-author-text">%%content%%</div></div>';
}
add_filter('wp_about_author_template', 'my_wp_about_author_template');
?>`

= Can I add additional social media links? =

As of version 1.3 you can. Once again using a filter you can intercept the data that generates these links and add your own.

Example:
Add the following to a functionality plugin or your functions.php file
`<?php
function my_wp_about_author_social($social){
    $social['my_service_key'] = array(
        'link'=>'http://www.myservice.com/%%username%%',
        'title'=>'My Service',
        'icon'=>'http://www.fullpathtoicon.com/icon.png'
    );
    return '<div class="wp-about-author-containter-%%bordertype%%" style="background-color:%%borderbg%%;"><div class="wp-about-author-pic">%%authorpic%%</div><div class="wp-about-author-text">%%content%%</div></div>';
}
add_filter('wp_about_author_get_socials', 'my_wp_about_author_social');
?>`

= Can I filter the author box from additional pages not listed in my settings? =

Sure thing. Now there's a WordPress filter for that.

Example:
Add the following to a functionality plugin or your functions.php file to exclude the author box from a page with the id equal to 100
`<?php
function my_wp_about_author_display($author_content){
    if(is_page(100))
        return "";
    return $author_content;
}
add_filter('wp_about_author_display', 'my_wp_about_author_display');
?>`


= Are there any other filters that let me modify the output? =

The following filters have been added:
wp_about_author_name - Modify the output of the name in the author box
wp_about_author_description - Modify the output of the description in the author box
wp_about_author_more_posts - Modify the "More Posts" text in the author box
wp_about_author_website - Modify the "Website" text in the author box
wp_about_author_follow_me - Modify the "Follow Me:" text in the author box
