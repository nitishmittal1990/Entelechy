== What's Changed? ==
Version 0.3
- Fixed problem with no default array value in the category exclude option.  By default, the option was set to a string value when it should have been an array value.  Caused an error until the user modified the options for the first time.

Version 0.2
- Fixed problem where the TOC only showed 5 posts even if there were more.
Version 0.1
- Initial public beta released.  Just install and activate.  Change options as required.
