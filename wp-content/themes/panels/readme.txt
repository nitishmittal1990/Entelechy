Panels is a totally free WordPress theme with custom header and custom background features

It is clean, fast loading and displays a featured image for each post (200px by 200px) to give a beautifully simple and consistent feel to your website.

You can set this featured image for each post simply by clicking on "Featured image" when editing each post, selecting an image, and then saving the post.

The header is 770 pixels wide by 180 pixels high.

The theme is highly customisable, and supports:

Widgets in two locations (right footer, and left footer columns)
Custom Menus in 3 locations (Header, Left Footer and Right Footer)
Custom Backgrounds
Custom Header Image

You can use this theme and the images supplied for whatever purpose you want - personal sites, paid sites, commercial use etc.

The header images were adapted from photographs taken by me - feel free to use or modify them however you wish.

The website should all be valid XHTML - and has been tested in multiple browsers.
